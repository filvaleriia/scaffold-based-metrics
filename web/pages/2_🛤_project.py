    The goal of the project is to experimentally test the behavior of metrics I have designed for two different molecular generators and compare them with each other. Within the scope of this project, two molecular generators will be tested: DrugEx, which is based on deep learning, and Molpher, which is based on evolutionary algorithms.

    For splitting data to clusters we convert data to CSK scaffolds and try to split data based the scaffold similarity(tanimoto distance) using K-medoids algorithm
    We divided all data for 5 clusters, and then for "dissimilarity" part we selectd four clusters for sIS and another one to sRS. And we done this five times. Than for creating cIS and cRS we found all compound wich have scaffold in sIS and sRS.
