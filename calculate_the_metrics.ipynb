    "# Molecular Generator Evaluation using TUPOR, SESY and ASER Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "üîπ **Objective**  \n",
    "This notebook evaluates molecular generators by computing four key metrics:  \n",
    "   - **TUPOR**: scaffold recall metrics  \n",
    "   - **SESY**: scaffold hopping potencial  \n",
    "   - **ASER**: chemical space exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "üîπ **Workflow**  \n",
    "1Ô∏è‚É£ **Compute Metrics**: The script calculates TUPOR, SESY and ASER for different molecular generators.  \n",
    "2Ô∏è‚É£ **Merge Data**: Results from multiple generators are combined into a single Pandas DataFrame.  \n",
    "3Ô∏è‚É£ **Normalize Values**: The computed metrics are normalized using Min-Max scaling for comparison.  \n",
    "4Ô∏è‚É£ **Save Outputs**: Processed data is stored in CSV files for further analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "üîπ **Data Structure**  \n",
    "- The calculations are performed for different **scaffold types** (`csk`, `murcko`) and **cluster types** (`dis`, `sim`).  \n",
    "- Results are computed for multiple **generators** (`Molpher`, `REINVENT`, `DrugEx`, `GB_GA`, etc.).  \n",
    "- The analysis is conducted for a specific **biological target receptor**, such as the **Glucocorticoid receptor**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook allows us to compare the performance of various molecular generators in terms of structural diversity, similarity to known bioactive compounds, and synthetic feasibility."
